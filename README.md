# Gas_particles
A school project modelling gas molecules sticking together in a closed tank. It was made by me and a fellow student under supervision of our curator. I was responsible for the simulation and visualisation parts.

ATTENTION: The visual part heavily blinks, so be aware and try not to cause seizures by it.

A quick guide for using the program:

The top button initializes the values set in the fields.

Those values are: N - number of particles, R - radius of each, E - average energy of the particles, Eприл - chcracteristic energy of them sticking together, MaxX and MaxY - dimensions of the tank.

The second button starts/ends the simulation.

The third button pauses/continues the simulation.

The last button does nothing! Apparently, it is not the last version, that I dug out.

dT switch fastens the time, so that the final result is quicker to achive.

Below is a graph panel with a button that shows/hides analytical graphs in real time.
